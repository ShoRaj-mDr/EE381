Simple Lab Projects done in python.

Project 1: Pseudorandom number generator with a uniform distribution of number in the set [0,1). Flipping a coin or Rolling a Die. A sample simulations using 
a system clock timer to generate pseudorandom number.

Project 2: What is the probability of a head on an odd flip?? A program that solves the problem using simulation that models the probability experiment and then is repeated a number of times. Correctly evaluating the results of the simulation will make it possible to determine an approximate answer to the probability of a coin.
